           warning: the file "savestate-release.keystore" should be created only once [per application] otherwise it will fail [and NEVER delete it!]
 
4) [Gradle]: Edit/change the values [123456] "--ks-pass pass:" and "--key-pass pass:" in project file "gradle-local-apksigner.bat" [or .sh]  according "keytool_input.txt" file

5) [Gradle]: Execute the [project] command "gradle-local-apksigner.bat" [.sh] to get the [release] signed Apk!
             OR execute "gradle-local-universal-apksigner.bat" [.sh] if your are supporting multi-architecture (ex.: armeabi-v7a + arm64-v8a + ...) 
             hint: look for your generated "SaveState-release.apk" in [project] folder "...\build\outputs\apk\release"
 

6) [Ant]: Execute the [project] command "ant-build-release.bat" [.sh] to get the [release] signed Apk!"
          hint: look for your generated "SaveState-release.apk" in [project] folder "...\bin"
